InvisAble – AR/VR Learning Platform for Visually Impaired Students
Overview

InvisAble is an inclusive EdTech project that uses Augmented
Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Text-to-Speech (TTS)
technologies to support visually impaired and blind students.

The platform creates a multi-sensory learning environment using
sound, touch, and spatial awareness instead of visual elements,
making education more accessible and engaging.

Problem Statement

Most educational content is designed mainly for sighted learners.
Existing assistive tools like screen readers offer limited
interaction and do not provide immersive or spatial learning.

Current AR/VR systems also depend heavily on visual elements and
lack the tactile and auditory features required by visually
impaired students. This creates a major accessibility gap.

There is a need for an inclusive solution that combines:

Spatial audio for navigation and orientation

Tactile and haptic feedback for interaction

Adaptive Text-to-Speech (TTS) for real-time guidance

Personalized learning experiences

Proposed Solution

InvisAble uses AR and VR in a non-visual way by shifting the focus
to audio guidance and touch-based interaction.

With spatial sound, voice commands, and haptic feedback, visually
impaired students can explore objects, environments, and concepts
in an immersive and interactive manner.

This approach converts AR/VR into an effective learning tool for
blind learners by enabling multi-sensory understanding.

Conclusion

InvisAble demonstrates the power of immersive technology in
breaking educational barriers for visually impaired students.

By combining sound, touch, and intelligent guidance, the platform
offers an engaging and empowering learning experience.

It represents a strong step toward a more equal, accessible, and
inclusive education system for everyone.
