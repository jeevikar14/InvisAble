🌟 InvisAble – Inclusive AR/VR Learning Platform for Visually Impaired Students
Overview
InvisAble is an innovative educational accessibility project that combines Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to support visually impaired and blind students. The platform is designed to break traditional learning barriers by offering a multi-sensory experience based on sound, touch, and spatial awareness instead of vision.
The goal of InvisAble is to create an inclusive, immersive, and interactive learning environment that allows visually disabled learners to explore concepts independently and confidently.

Problem Statement
Visually impaired children face major obstacles in accessing traditional educational systems, as the majority of content is designed primarily for sighted learners. Current assistive technologies like screen readers and audio books provide basic support, but they lack interactivity and fail to deliver deep conceptual understanding.
Moreover, most existing AR and VR applications rely heavily on visual input and do not offer sufficient tactile or advanced auditory features for blind or low-vision students. This creates a significant accessibility gap.
There is a critical need for an inclusive AR/VR-based learning platform that integrates:
Spatial audio for navigation and orientation
Tactile and haptic feedback for touch-based interaction
Adaptive Text-to-Speech (TTS) for real-time content narration
Personalized learning modules based on individual needs
Such a platform can provide equal learning opportunities and meaningful educational experiences for visually impaired children.

Proposed Solution
InvisAble uses AR/VR in a non-visual way by shifting the focus to audio guidance and tactile interaction. Through spatial sound, voice commands, and haptic feedback, visually impaired students can explore concepts, objects, and environments in an interactive and immersive manner.
This approach transforms AR/VR into a powerful educational tool for blind learners.

Key Features
Audio-based navigation and interaction
Tactile learning through haptic feedback
Real-time Text-to-Speech guidance
Personalized learning modules
Inclusive and accessible user design

Conclusion
InvisAble demonstrates how immersive technologies can break educational barriers for visually impaired students. By combining sound, touch, and intelligent guidance, the platform offers an inclusive, engaging, and empowering learning experience. It represents a step toward a more accessible and equal education system for everyone.
